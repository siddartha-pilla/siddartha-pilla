Bindiya was found on the streets of Birubari area in Guwahati. The public called to report a mentally disturbed women behaving in a socially unacceptable manner. 
The rescue team brought her to the Transit Care center of Navachetana, a rehabilitation home for homeless women with mental illness. She was so disturbed that she tried to run away the minute she was brought to the home. 
She was enrolled in the home and given a bath and a change of clothes. In her early days at the home, Bindiya used to stay unkempt. She would keep muttering to herself. She carried a pile of garbage that she wasn't willing to part with. 
Once she settled down, she was sent for medical examination. She was diagnosed with Chronic Schizophrenia. The home then started pharmacotherapy for her. 
In the initial days, Bindiya was irritable. Psycho-therapeutic sessions failed as she would present a guarded attitude and not cooperate. Sometimes she would walk out from the room. She remained emotionally and socially withdrawn. It was a challenge to communicate with her. 
She would even refrain from maintaining basic personal hygiene and lacked toilet habits. The staff had to constantly prod her to carry out activities of daily living. 
Over time as her therapy continued, her active symptoms of mental illness reduced. She was then shifted to her second phase of rehabilitation.. 
She started to get involved in household chores that required sharing responsibilities. This helped in her socialization skills. She learnt jute work that helped in refining her fine motor skills. 
The therapists noted that her sense of responsibility was very high. She would never leave a job unfinished. Her social and motor skills were honed by giving her responsibilities that required her to supervise other residents. From being non cooperative, she soon started taking care of other residents. 
Over a few months of therapy and workshops Bindiya recovered her memory. She remembered that she was from Jirrah village of Bankura district, West Bengal. 
Ashadeep then initiated a plan for her reintegration with her family. When the reintegration team reached Bindiya place, the entire community gathered to welcome her. 
The team learnt that she had been suffering from psychiatric illness for almost 30 years. Though they had initially sought treatment, they had to discontinue it as they couldn't afford it. One day she disappeared from home and over the years they had come to believe that she must have died while wandering on the streets. 
Her husband and children were at a loss of words to express their emotions. 
Bindiya had accepted her illness as her life dictation. It was due to Ashadeep tireless determination that she was finally home after 10 long years!

Appeal Manjhi is 52 years old. He belongs to the Manjhi tribe and lives with his family in a little village called Puri. 
Puri is a small village in Raigarh, Chhattisgarh. The Manjhi tribe depends on the forest for their livelihood. The area is rich in non timber forest produce. Appeal family used to work in the forest. But most of their produce went to a few businessmen at a nearby town called Kudumkela. 
This was the reality for most of the Manjhi tribals in Puri. The businessmen in Kudumkela provided cash, clothes, and other requirements on loans. The loans were repaid with forest produce. 
This led to the family living hand to mouth. They longed to live without having to worry about their next meal. Their problems became worse when Appeal son, Rajnikant got addicted to alcohol. 
It was during this time that Janmitram started the agriculture development program in their village. They worked to make better use of the degraded and waste land by developing horticulture and vegetable promotion. 
Appeal wanted to take their help and develop his land. However, the program failed as villagers were unwilling to cooperate with Janmitram. 
But Appeal vowed to change this with help from Janmitram. He planted fruits and vegetables on whichever parts of the land he could. In the first year, the produce was not good. Puri was a place where open grazing was common which affected his crops. 
His son Rajinikanth also squandered the minimal earnings they received on alcohol. 
In spite of all this, nothing could derail Appeal from the path he chose. 
With the support of Janmitram, he brought up the issues he faced with open grazing in the panchayat. He erected a fence around his land. **Janmitram helped Appeal choose crops that improved soil such as sunflower, pea and cauliflower. He erected a hut in the field and kept around the clock vigil. He then helped his son stop his alcohol habit with constant motivation and got him to work on the farm with him. ** 
All the hard work paid off and that season he sold a whopping Rs. 76,000 worth of vegetables. 
His farm inspired those around him. In the next season, many other residents of Puri replicated Appeal farm. Most of them enrolled in the Janmitram program and succeeded in earning well. 
Over time, more and more villagers began to shift to agriculture until the old system was completely done away. In 2016, the whole village produced 26 tons of onion alone! 
f you do good, things will turn good for you,says Appeal, with a toothy grin. 
Appeal Manjhi appeal in Puri is now unanimous. He is however, most proud of his son Rajinikanth who left alcohol and turned into a passionate farmer.

This inner urge and burning desire motivated her to start an organisation for the cause of women, especially Dalit.The founder's father was a school head master and she always had an inclination towards social service looking at the condition of the people living in remote areas of her village, especially women.

Bleeding can occur internally, into joints and muscles, or externally, from minor cuts, dental procedures or trauma. 
Currently, there is no cure for hemophilia. The main method of treatment for hemophilia A is to intravenously infuse a concentrated FVIII product called clotting factor or simply factor through a vein in the arm or a port in the chest. 
Living with a disease that has no cure, Nagaraju always has to be ready for life threatening situations. On one instance he got affected with a peritoneal bleed - an internal bleeding. He was admitted in the Little Star's Children Hospital.

Unfortunately, she couldn't bear children. This news devastated her and she fell into depression. To help her overcome depression, her siblings let her raise their children. Her husband earned a meager income but was happy to support her in raising the children. Over time, the children got married and her husband passed away. The marriage of the children and the death of her husband hit Bi with loneliness.
Bi, then started raising and selling goats for earning her livelihood. However, one goat changed Bi's life. She instantly connected with her. Bi named her Sita. Sita showed a lot of human emotions and they both grew very fond of each other.
One day Bi noticed a lump on her breast. Further tests confirmed that she was in an advanced stage of breast cancer. Afraid of the cost and suspicious of hospitals, Bi denied treatment. 
It was then that a relative referred her to Karunashraya. She visited Karunashraya and agreed to get admitted as she felt cared for by the staff. In no time Bi became one of the favorite patients of the doctors, counselors and nursing staff.
While they cared well for her, Bi was always concerned about Sita. Her niece had informed her that Sita was unwell and depressed. Bi insisted on going home to visit the goat who had now become her daughter. But Bi's condition had deteriorated and she couldn't be sent home.
And so began the long journey of bringing Sita to the hospital to fulfil Bi's last wish.
The staff at Karunashraya made all efforts to bring Sita to the place. Sita, unfamiliar with the sound and feel of vehicles and would keep trying jump out of the vehicles. After three days of failed attempts, the staff managed to bring Sita to the hospital on a two-wheeler!
Karunashraya had seen many reunions and wishes being fulfilled but a wish in the form of a goat was new. All the staff followed Sita to Bi's ward and the whole place was lit with smiles and tears of joy.
Sita was surprisingly disciplined. She walked along one side of the corridor and seemed calm and composed. On meeting Bi, she turned her face away and refused to look up at her. It was as if she was annoyed with Bi for staying away from her for over 6 months. She relented only when an overwhelmed Bi picked her up and placed her on her lap. A happy Sita peacefully dozed off on her lap.
The goat slept in Bi's lap like it had finally reached home after a long journey. Bi spent the whole day with her relatives and Sita and looked like she couldn't have asked for more.
A few days later, Bi bid goodbye to the world knowing Sita was in good hands.

Shabnam Seth is a 5 year old girl who lives with her parents in the construction workers' slum in Powai, Mumbai. Both her parents are daily wage workers.

They enrolled in the Kindergarten at Udaan and made a commitment that they will enroll her in a government (BMC) school after kindergarten. 
Shabnam now studies in the Tirandaz Municipal School in Powai. She loves school and her new friends. Her day is no longer filled with domestic chores but rather learning and playing with her friends. She also gets a nutritious snack before she goes back home.

Sobha is a 42-year-old and lives in Kusumgram. She works at a small handicraft shop in her village. She had three young children. Sobha was the only earning member in her family. She had the sole responsibility of their livelihood and of her children's education.
A few months ago, she started to suffer from severe headaches. This affected her focus and precision. Her headaches and blurred vision hindered her work. It led to difficulties in carrying out her daily chores.
Her supervisors started rebuking her for the errors she was making. She feared that she might lose her job if she continued to make mistakes.
She couldn't afford expensive check-ups with her low income. She was entirely at a loss, and her condition worsened.
One of her neighbors then referred her to the RHCF health center. She decided to visit the center of Rural Health Care Foundation for a check-up. She attended the center once she came to know that the fee charged was nominal and within her reach.
The health center clinic was well-equipped with qualified professionals. They guided Sobha and assisted her with a proper eye check-up. 
She was given a pair of spectacles at a subsidized rate for correcting her vision. She was also prescribed with eye-drops and medicines. 
The spectacles and medication have helped Sobha regain her vision. Now her work doesn't get affected and she does not live in fear of losing her job. 
She visits the health center for regular checks.

Under education, Sarthak Prayas runs remedial education centers where students from government schools attend classes every day to improve their knowledge. The centres help students complete their homework and revise lessons of the day. They also impart life skills and teach them how to deal with real life situations.

Each day the students attend sessions for approximately 90 minutes. Their other program focuses on people at the other end of the age spectrum, the underprivileged elderly.

They have now reached an age where their bodies don't allow them to work a lot and their economic conditions do not allow their families to be able to take care of them either.Sarthak Prayas visits the slums and identifies elderly people who were unable to take care of themselves.

The Institute was started by Mr. Pranjal Dubey, who left his high profile job in SAP Labs, Bangalore to set up this institute in his native village. Pranjal Dubey comes from a family that traditionally provided the head priest for the Sant Singaji Temple at Sandalpur in Madhya Pradesh. At his father's passing in 1996 it was his duty to take over this role, and although he returned to Sandalpur annually for the temple festival, he continued his career as a software engineer in Bengaluru with the blessing of the village elders. Every time he visited he encountered desperation from parents and youth who struggled to rise above poverty, despite the education and qualifications accessible to them. On investigation, he found the education available to local youth to be substandard. It became clear that he had a mission to change this and the chain of poverty that was left behind. In only 7 years, the organization has achieved stellar results . 15 students, 14 of them being girls have obtained University ranks, putting Sandalpur on the education map of Madhya Pradesh. Many of their graduates are working in companies in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Indore, Pune, etc in companies such as Cognizant, Wipro, CapGemini, SAP Labs, Infosys, etc.... Read more"

This created problem in communicating with them. The change was very hard for them and they took a long time to adjust. They would mostly be found crying and barely spoke in the first eight months.
""We were always crying and hated to go out of the house. Most of the days, we both would just cry and sit on the porch waiting for our grandmother to take us back home, `` says Archana emotionally.
A kindergarten teacher introduced them to dance in an effort to cheer them up and make them more comfortable with their surroundings and their new mother at school. It helped them accept the change in their lives and they slowly started communicating with the mother and other children. They enjoyed dancing and started waiting for their classes. ""We found a new way to channelise our emotions, which we could barely recognise, let alone articulate and express. Dance helped us communicate with others, it was an outlet for our emotions. We are attending the dance classes regularly from then, `` says Chetana.  
""There is a very vivid memory of a day when we both came very late (around 12am) from our dance class. Because we had always stayed in a very protected and sheltered environment at school, we were scared to be alone outside that late. Lokesh uncle (Village Director) counselled us and explained that soon we would be setting foot in the outside world, where we ourselves have to find our way and handle things. He also helped us make the right career decisions. Both of us have always been academically bright and we decided to do Engineering and got qualified as Information Science Engineers"", says Archana.  
This sisters duo is also an acclaimed Bharatnatyam performers. An introduction to dancing helped them transform their childhood into a happy and fulfilling one. Trained under legendary gurus Devaki Narasimhan, B. Bhanumati and Sheela Chandrashekar, the sisters have been dancing for the past two decades and are acknowledged as top most duet performers in the country. Archana and Chetana have also been honoured as Cultural Ambassadors of India by the prestigious Indian Council for Cultural Relations.

Laxmi Dev Amma is one of the rural farmers in Chikmagalur district of Karnataka on whose land the team of SankalpTaru had carried out its Rural Livelihood Support Program. Because of scanty rainfall, the district faced severe water scarcity to the level of a serious lack of drinking water and utmost level of ground water depletion. Due to this, Laxmi Dev Amma and other farmers in the region faced multiple crop failures leading to the increasing level of suicides among them. Thus, the need to increase the water level and rainfall in the area so as to sustain the livelihood of the farmers came into consideration.
Here's when Team SankalpTaru intervened and came into action. SankalpTaru Foundation initiated Rural Livelihood Support Program in the Chikmagalur district. The team members planted the saplings of Areca Nut on the land of Laxmi Dev Amma and other farmer beneficiaries. Areca nut is one of the most important commercial plants because of its twofold use - the first one being the yielding of 5.5 to 7 kilos of betel nut per tree per year, and the second one being used as an eco-cutlery.
The Areca nut saplings produce maximum yield in minimum amount of water. This had increased the yields in the land Laxmi Dev Amma and other farmer beneficiaries so that they can earn regular income without any major loss. The drip irrigation system is used by the farmers to water the saplings. Also, eco-cutlery made from these plants after they shed are an alternative source of income for the farmers during times when there is little yield.
This intervention by SankalpTaru Foundation has given a ray of hope to farmer beneficiaries like Laxmi Dev Amma and others. Laxmi Dev Amma is now acting as a mentor to other farmers, both men and women. 
Rural Livelihood Support Program has acted as a pillar to provide hope and strength to rural farmers in the states of Uttarakhand and Karnataka.
Your contribution towards the project will act as a major step in increasing the agriculture, enriching the biodiversity, and saving the lives of the farmers. So, don't wait, plant a tree now and save a life!
","SankalpTaru Foundation, as the names suggests, is an e-NGO or an IT enabled NGO, as you may call it, active across 18 Indian cities with its pledge to plant trees for the people, by the people. The organisation believes that planting trees has many benefits, ranging from the power to fight pollution, strengthening the livelihood of farmers, to increasing the life expectancy of our planet.With the mission to create a clean, green and healthy planet and a vision to enrich the biodiversity with lush green plants, SankalpTaru works with all their capabilities to plant as much trees as possible so that our present as well as the future generations can have a bio-diverse sustainable environment.Since the plantation drive is for the people, by the people, SankalpTaru uses geo-tagging and other advanced environmental techniques in order to make it easier for people to track their planted trees.
